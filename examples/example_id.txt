// replace the code inside "func" in "speckle_generator_main.cpp" line 27 and in "MC_estimation_cuda.cu" line 32 with the identity mapping function (no deformation) as follows:

    *x_out = x_in;
    *y_out = y_in;

// save both files

// re-build the executable by running "make"

// you can generate the figure results by running the following command line:
./cuSpeckle ref_star.png -width 500 -height 500
